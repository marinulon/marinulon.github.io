> # Bench PR Branding and Website
> ## Melbourne PR agency BENCH PR specialises in getting tech companies talked about.
> ### Starting with designing BENCH PR a new logo to reflect the idea of a "benchmark" that the brand is built around, I designed a website that showcases the firm's high-profile clients and impressive results.
> Using a series of collages created from real media headlines about each company, linked through to detailed case studies., the website is dynamic, business-like and focused on results.

 > Services: Branding and website design.
