> # Curve Magazine
> ## Curve is an industrial and product design magazine read by designers and manufacturers around the world.
> ### The magazine's website was dowdy and limited; a new website was needed to impress potential subscribers and add value for existing ones.
> The site is built around a blog containing up-to-date design news, and a full magazine archive for subscribers.

> **Australian Web Awards 2011:** Finalist, E-commerce category. <br/>Services: Illustration and website design.
